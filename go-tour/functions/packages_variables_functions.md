### Packages
Every Go program is made up of packages.
Programs start running in package main.
This program is using the packages with import paths "fmt" and "math/rand".
By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. For instance, the "math/rand" package comprises files that begin with the statement package rand.
Note: The environment in which these programs are executed is deterministic, so each time you run the example program rand.Intn will return the same number.
(To see a different number, seed the number generator; see rand.Seed. Time is constant in the playground, so you will need to use something else as the seed.)

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}
```
### Imports
This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.
You can also write multiple import statements, like:
    import "fmt"
    import "math"
But it is good style to use the factored import statement.

### Exported names
In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, Pizza is an exported name, as is Pi, which is exported from the math package.
pizza and pi do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.
When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.
Run the code. Notice the error message.
To fix the error, rename math.pi to math.Pi and try it again.
```
func main() {
    fmt.Println(math.Pi)
}
```
### Functions
A function can take zero or more arguments.
In this example, add takes two parameters of type int.
Notice that the type comes after the variable name.
(For more about why types look the way they do, see the article on Go's declaration syntax.)

```
func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```
#### Consecutive named function parameters share a type
When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.
In this example, we shortened
    x int, y int
to
    x, y int

#### Multiple results
A function can return any number of results.
The swap function returns two strings
```
func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
    return y, x
}

func main() {
    a, b := swap("hello", "world")
    fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

#### Named return values
Go's return values may be named. If so, they are treated as variables defined at the top of the function.
These names should be used to document the meaning of the return values.
A return statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return.
Naked return statements should be used only in short functions, as with the example shown here. They can harm readability in longer functions.
```
func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
    x = sum * 4 / 9
    y = sum - x
    return
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(split(17))
}
```
#### Variables
The var statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.
A var statement can be at package or function level. We see both in this example.

```
import "fmt"

var c, python, java bool

func main() {
    var i int
    fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)
}
```
#### Variables with initializers
A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable.
If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; the variable will take the type of the initializer.
```
var i, j int = 1, 2

func main() {
	var c, python, java = true, false, "no!"
	fmt.Println(i, j, c, python, java)
}
```

#### Short variable declarations
Inside a function, the := short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type.
Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.
```
func main() {
    var i, j int = 1, 2
    k := 3
    c, python, java := true, false, "no!"
	fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)
}
```

#### Basic types
Go's basic types are
```
    bool
    
    string

    int  int8  int16  int32  int64
    uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

    byte // alias for uint8

    rune // alias for int32
    // represents a Unicode code point

    float32 float64

    complex64 complex128
```
The example shows variables of several types, and also that variable declarations may be "factored" into blocks, as with import statements.
The int, uint, and uintptr types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems. 
When you need an integer value you should use int unless you have a specific reason to use a sized or unsigned integer type.

```
import (
    "fmt"
    "math/cmplx"
)

var (
    ToBe   bool       = false
    MaxInt uint64     = 1<<64 - 1
    z      complex128 = cmplx.Sqrt(-5 + 12i)
)

func main() {
    fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", ToBe, ToBe)
    fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", MaxInt, MaxInt)
    fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", z, z)
}
```

#### Zero values
Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value. 
The zero value is:
- 0 for numeric types,
- false for the boolean type, and
- "" (the empty string) for strings.

```
import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i int
	var f float64
	var b bool
	var s string
	fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)
}
```

#### Type conversions
The expression T(v) converts the value v to the type T.
Some numeric conversions:

    var i int = 42
    var f float64 = float64(i)
    var u uint = uint(f)

Or, put more simply:

    i := 42
    f := float64(i)
    u := uint(f)

Unlike in C, in Go assignment between items of different type requires an explicit conversion. 
```
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	var x, y int = 3, 4
	var f float64 = math.Sqrt(float64(x*x + y*y))
	var z uint = uint(f)
	fmt.Println(x, y, z)
}
```
Try removing the float64 or uint conversions in the example and see what happens.
```
func main() {
	var x, y int = 3, 4
	var f float64 = math.Sqrt((x*x + y*y))
	var z uint = uint(f)
	fmt.Println(x, y, z)
}
./prog.go:10:28: cannot use (x * x + y * y) (value of type int) as type float64 in argument to math.Sqrt
```

#### Type inference
When declaring a variable without specifying an explicit type (either by using the := syntax or var = expression syntax), 
the variable's type is inferred from the value on the right hand side.

When the right hand side of the declaration is typed, the new variable is of that same type:

    var i int
    j := i // j is an int

But when the right hand side contains an untyped numeric constant, the new variable may be an int, float64, or complex128 depending on the precision of the constant:

    i := 42           // int
    f := 3.142        // float64
    g := 0.867 + 0.5i // complex128

Try changing the initial value of v in the example code and observe how its type is affected.


#### Constants
Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.
Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.
Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.
```
const Pi = 3.14

func main() {
	const World = "世界"
	fmt.Println("Hello", World)
	fmt.Println("Happy", Pi, "Day")

	const Truth = true
	fmt.Println("Go rules?", Truth)
}
```

#### Numeric Constants
Numeric constants are high-precision values.
An untyped constant takes the type needed by its context.
Try printing needInt(Big) too.
(An int can store at maximum a 64-bit integer, and sometimes less.)

```
import "fmt"

const (
	// Create a huge number by shifting a 1 bit left 100 places.
	// In other words, the binary number that is 1 followed by 100 zeroes.
	Big = 1 << 100
	// Shift it right again 99 places, so we end up with 1<<1, or 2.
	Small = Big >> 99
)

func needInt(x int) int { return x*10 + 1 }
func needFloat(x float64) float64 {
	return x * 0.1
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(needInt(Small))
	fmt.Println(needFloat(Small))
	fmt.Println(needFloat(Big))
}
// 21
// 0.2
// 1.2676506002282295e+29
```
